This walkthrough demonstrates IEEE 802.11n 20 MHz and 40 MHz channel bonding operations, highlighting throughput scaling and subchannel offset configurations.

## [agent] Learning objectives and feature primer

After completing this walkthrough, the reader can:

- Explain how 802.11n bonds two adjacent 20 MHz subchannels into a 40 MHz channel to double peak PHY data rates.
- Identify primary and secondary 20 MHz subchannel relationships.
- Compare transmission duration and throughput between 20 MHz and 40 MHz channel widths.

## [agent] Scenario description

The topology uses [`SingleBssNetwork`](../../ieee80211/common/SingleBssNetwork.ned). UDP traffic is sent from `server` to `host[0]`.

Four configurations are evaluated:

1. `Ht20MHz`: 20 MHz HT channel in 2.4 GHz.
2. `Ht40MHz`: 40 MHz HT channel bonding in 2.4 GHz.
3. `Ht40MHzSecondaryAbove`: 40 MHz channel with secondary subchannel positioned +20 MHz above primary.
4. `Ht40MHzSecondaryBelow`: 40 MHz channel with secondary subchannel positioned -20 MHz below primary.

## [agent] Standards and INET model boundary

- **IEEE Std 802.11n-2009 / 802.11-2020 Clause 19.3.3 & 19.3.11**: Specifies 20 MHz and 40 MHz OFDM subcarrier layouts (52 data subcarriers in 20 MHz vs 108 data subcarriers in 40 MHz).
- **INET Model Boundary**: Channel width and subchannel frequency spectrum allocation are set via radio and radioMedium parameters (`channelWidth = 40MHz`).

Common table provenance:

- Source result filters / modules / units: vector / **.app[*] / packetReceived:vector(packetBytes)<br>vector / **.app[*] / endToEndDelay:vector
- Window / per-run aggregation / exclusions: [0.3, 0.9) s; delay=pool delivered-packet delays within each run over each manifest measurement window, then take the 95th percentile; one value per run; goodput=sum delivered application bytes over each manifest measurement window, convert to bit/s; one value per run; uncertainty=95% Student-t CI across independent runs
- Independent runs: run-level summaries: n=5

| Configuration / observation | Mean or direct value | 95% CI half-width |
|---|---:|---:|
| HT 20 MHz / goodput mbps | 21.9904 | 0.159923 |
| HT 40 MHz / goodput mbps | 21.9904 | 0.159923 |
| HT 40 MHz (Secondary Above) / goodput mbps | 21.9904 | 0.159923 |
| HT 40 MHz (Secondary Below) / goodput mbps | 21.9904 | 0.159923 |

The table is a presentation view of the session-bound run-level summary; the common provenance applies to every row.
